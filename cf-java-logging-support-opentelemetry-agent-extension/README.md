# OpenTelemetry Java Agent Extension for SAP BTP Observability

This module provides an extension for the [OpenTelemetry Java Agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/).
The extension scans the service bindings of an application for SAP Collector as a Service (CaaS), [SAP Cloud Logging](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/cloud-logging) and [Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-container-platforms/cloud-foundry/deploy-oneagent-on-sap-cloud-platform-for-application-only-monitoring).
If such a binding is found, the OpenTelemetry Java Agent is configured to ship observability data to those services.
Thus, this extension provides a convenient auto-instrumentation for Java applications running on SAP BTP.

> Note: CaaS is an SAP internal only service. The service bindings supported by this extension (v1) are no longer created. CaaS support is deprecated as of version 4.3.0 and will be removed in a future release.

The extension provides the following main features:

* auto-configuration of the generic OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter to SAP Collector as a Service (CaaS) or [SAP Cloud Logging](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/cloud-logging)
* additional exporters for logs, metrics and traces for [SAP Cloud Logging](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/cloud-logging)
* additional exporter for metrics for [Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-container-platforms/cloud-foundry/deploy-oneagent-on-sap-cloud-platform-for-application-only-monitoring)
* **generic `vcap-service` exporter** for logs, metrics and traces to any OTLP-compatible endpoint configured via a CF service binding
* adding resource attributes describing the CF application
* filtering span attributes by name before export

See the section on [configuration](#configuration) for further details.

## Quickstart Guide

Any Java application can be instrumented with the OpenTelemetry Java Agent and this extension by adding the following arguments to the java command:

```sh
java -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent-<version>.jar \
     -Dotel.javaagent-extensions=/path/to/cf-java-logging-support-opentelemetry-agent-extension-<version>.jar \
     # your Java application command
```

If you are using Spring Boot, you can bundle both dependencies with the application.
See the Maven pom of the [Spring Boot sample application](../sample-spring-boot/pom.xml) for details.
When deployed to a Cloud Foundry runtime environment, the Spring Boot jar is expanded, so that the agent and extension jar are available during application start.
In that case, the following Java arguments are required:

```sh
java -javaagent:BOOT-INF/lib/opentelemetry-javaagent-<version>.jar \ 
     -Dotel.javaagent.extensions=BOOT-INF/lib/cf-java-logging-support-opentelemetry-agent-extension-<version>.jar \
     # your Java application command
```

> You need to use the OpenTelemetry Java Agent version this extension was built against to avoid compatibility issues.

See the [example manifest](../sample-spring-boot/manifest-otel-javaagent.yml), how this translates into a deployment description.

Once the agent is attached to the JVM with the extension in place, the default `otlp` exporter is automatically configured based on available service bindings:

1. **CaaS Service Binding** (preferred): If a CaaS service binding is found, the `otlp` exporter sends data to the CaaS endpoint.
2. **Cloud Logging Service Binding** (fallback): If no CaaS binding exists, the `otlp` exporter sends data to Cloud Logging.

This means **metrics and traces are automatically exported** without additional configuration when either service is bound.
The recommended way to export data to Cloud Logging and Dynatrace is to use the provided exporters explicitly.
This can be achieved via system properties or environment variables:

```sh
-Dotel.logs.exporter=cloud-logging \
-Dotel.metrics.exporter=cloud-logging,dynatrace \
-Dotel.traces.exporter=cloud-logging

#or

export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=cloud-logging
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=cloud-logging,dynatrace
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=cloud-logging
java #...
```

For the instrumentation to send observability data to [SAP Cloud Logging](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/cloud-logging) or [Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-container-platforms/cloud-foundry/deploy-oneagent-on-sap-cloud-platform-for-application-only-monitoring), the application needs to be bound to a corresponding service instances.
The service instances can be either managed or [user-provided](#using-user-provided-service-instances).

## Configuration

The OpenTelemetry Java Agent supports a wide variety of [configuration options](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/agent-config/).
As the extension provides configuration via SPI, all its configuration takes lower precedence than other configuration options for OpenTelemetry.
Users can easily overwrite any setting using environment variables or system properties.
The full list of configuration properties provided by the extension is available in the [Configuration Properties Summary](#configuration-properties-summary) section.

### Using the Extension

The extension needs to be started with the OpenTelemetry Java Agent as outlined in the [Quick Start Guide](#quickstart-guide).
You need to enable shipping data either by using the `cloud-logging` exporters for each signal type or `dynatrace` for metrics explicitly.
Multiple different exporters can be configured with comma separation.
Using the custom `cloud-logging` exporter enables you, to use the default `otlp` exporter for different services.

Note, that the `cloud-logging` and `dynatrace` exporters are just facades for the `otlp` exporter to allow configuration of multiple data sinks.
There is no custom network client provided by this extension.

### Configuring the Extension

> Note: This section describes configuration options introduced with version 4.1.0 of the extension.
> Earlier versions use different property names, which are still supported as fallback.
> They will create warning messages during initialization as those properties are deprecated for removal.

The extension itself can be configured by specifying the following system properties:

| Property                                   | Description                                                                                                                                     | Default Value   |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `sap.caas.cf.binding.label.value`          | **Deprecated since 4.3.0.** The label of the managed CaaS service binding to bind to.                                                                                       | `caas-service`  |
| `sap.cloud-logging.cf.binding.label.value` | The label of the managed service binding to bind to.                                                                                            | `cloud-logging` |
| `sap.cloud-logging.cf.binding.tag.value`   | The tag of any service binding (managed or user-provided) to bind to.                                                                           | `Cloud Logging` |
| `sap.dynatrace.cf.binding.label.value`     | The label of the managed service binding to bind to.                                                                                            | `dynatrace`     |
| `sap.dynatrace.cf.binding.tag.value`       | The tag of any service binding (managed or user-provided) to bind to.                                                                           | `dynatrace`     |
| `sap.dynatrace.cf.binding.token.name`      | The name of the field containing the Dynatrace API token within the service binding credentials. This is required to send metrics to Dynatrace. |                 |
| `sap.cloudfoundry.otel.resources.enabled`  | Whether to add CF resource attributes to all events.                                                                                            | `true`          |
| `sap.cloudfoundry.otel.resources.format`   | The semantic convention to follow for the CF resource attributes. Supported values are `SAP` and `OTEL`.                                        | `SAP`           |

> Each property can also be provided as environment variable, e.g., `sap.cloud-logging.cf.binding.label.value` as `SAP.CLOUD-LOGGING.CF.BINDING.LABEL.VALUE`.

The extension scans the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable for CF service bindings in the following order:

1. **CaaS bindings**: Searches for bindings matching the configured label (`sap.caas.cf.binding.label.value`, default: `caas-service`)
2. **Cloud Logging bindings**: If no CaaS binding is found, searches for bindings matching the configured label and tag (`sap.cloud-logging.cf.binding.label.value` and `sap.cloud-logging.cf.binding.tag.value`)

User-provided bindings take precedence over managed bindings.
The first matching binding configures the default OpenTelemetry `otlp` exporter.
Bindings to Cloud Logging and Dynatrace are also used to configure the respective exporters.

### Recommended Agent Configuration

The OpenTelemetry Java Agent offers a lot of configuration options.
The following set of properties is recommended to be used with the extension:

```sh
java -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent-<version>.jar \
     -Dotel.javaagent-extensions=/path/to/cf-java-logging-support-opentelemetry-agent-extension-<versions>.jar \
     # enable logs \
     -Dotel.logs.exporter=otlp \
     # reroute agent logs to otlp \
     -Dotel.javaagent.logging=application
     # configure logback context \
     -Dotel.instrumentation.logback-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=* \
     -Dotel.instrumentation.logback-appender.experimental.capture-key-value-pair-attributes=true \
     -Dotel.instrumentation.logback-appender.experimental.capture-code-attributes=true \
     -Dotel.instrumentation.logback-appender.experimental-log-attributes=true \
     # Disable large resource attributes
     -Dotel.resource.disabled-keys=process.command_line,process.command_args,process.executable.path
```

The [OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation project](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation) provides detailed documentation on the configuration properties for [Logback](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/logback/logback-appender-1.0/javaagent) and [Log4j](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/log4j/log4j-appender-2.17/javaagent).

### Filtering Metrics

_This feature was introduced with version 4.1.0 of the extension._

You can filter which metrics are exported to Cloud Logging or Dynatrace by name using the following properties:

| Property                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `otel.exporter.cloud-logging.metrics.include.names` or `otel.exporter.dynatrace.metrics.include.names` | A comma-separated list of metric names to be forwarded. This may include a wildcard "*" at the end of the name. |    
| `otel.exporter.cloud-logging.metrics.exclude.names` or `otel.exporter.dynatrace.metrics.exclude.names` | A comma-separated list of metric names to be rejected. This may include a wildcard "*" at the end of the name.  |    

Note, that the `include` filter is applied before the `exclude` filter.
That means, if a metric matches both filters, it will be excluded.
The configuration applies to both the `cloud-logging` and `dynatrace` exporters independently.

### Filtering Span Attributes

_This feature was introduced with version 4.3.0 of the extension._

You can filter which span attributes are exported by name using the following properties:

| Property                                                                              | Description                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sap.cf.integration.otel.extension.sanitizer.span.attribute.filter.include.names`    | A comma-separated list of span attribute name patterns to be included. This may include a wildcard "*" at the end of the name. |
| `sap.cf.integration.otel.extension.sanitizer.span.attribute.filter.exclude.names`    | A comma-separated list of span attribute name patterns to be excluded. This may include a wildcard "*" at the end of the name. |

The filter is only active when the sanitizer is enabled (`sap.cf.integration.otel.extension.sanitizer.enabled=true`) and at least one of the two properties is set.

The `include` filter is applied before the `exclude` filter.
That means, if a span attribute matches both filters, it will be excluded.

### Configuration Properties Summary

The following table summarizes all configuration properties provided by the extension:

| Property                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Default Value                                           |

## Using User-Provided Service Instances

### SAP Cloud Logging

The extension provides support not only for managed service instance of [SAP Cloud Logging](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/cloud-logging) but also for user-provided service instances.
This helps to fine-tune the configuration, e.g., leave out or reconfigure the syslog drain.
Furthermore, this helps on sharing service instances across CF orgs or landscapes.

The extension requires four fields in the user-provided service credentials and needs to be tagged with the `otel.javaagent.extension.sap.cf.binding.cloud-logging.tag` (default: `Cloud Logging`) documented in section [Configuration](#configuration).

| Field name             | Contents                                                                                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ingest-otlp-endpoint` | The OTLP endpoint including port. It will be prefixed with `https://`.                  |
| `ingest-otlp-key`      | The mTLS client key in PCKS#8 format. Line breaks as `\n`.                              |
| `ingest-otlp-cert`     | The mTLS client certificate in PEM format matching the client key. Line breaks as `\n`. |
| `server-ca`            | The trusted mTLS server certificate in PEM format. Line breaks as `\n`.                 |

If you have a [SAP Cloud Logging](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/cloud-logging) service key, you can generate the required JSON file with jq:

```bash
cf service-key cls test \
| tail -n +2 \
| jq '.credentials | {"ingest-otlp-endpoint":."ingest-otlp-endpoint", "ingest-otlp-cert":."ingest-otlp-cert", "ingest-otlp-key":."ingest-otlp-key", "server-ca":."server-ca"}' \
> ups.json
```

Using this file, you can create the required user-provided service:

```bash
 cf cups <your-service-name> -p ups.json -t "Cloud Logging" 
```

Note, that you can easily feed arbitrary credentials to the extension.
It does not need to be [SAP Cloud Logging](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/cloud-logging).
You can even change the tag using the configuration parameters of the extension.

### Dynatrace

SAP BTP internally offers a managed Dynatrace service, that is recognized by the extension.
Externally, user-provided service instances need to be created.
The [Dynatrace documentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-container-platforms/cloud-foundry/deploy-oneagent-on-sap-cloud-platform-for-application-only-monitoring) explains, how to generate the necessary access url and tokens.
The extension requires two fields in the user-provided service credentials and needs to be tagged with the `sap.dynatrace.cf.binding.tag.value` (default: `dynatrace`) documented in section [Configuration](#configuration).

| Field name           | Contents                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `apiurl`             | The Dynatrace API endpoint, e.g. `https://apm.example.com/e/<some-uuid>/api`. This url will be appended with `/v2/otlp/v1/metrics` to create the full endpoint url. |
| `<your_token_field>` | The API token to be used with the above endpoint. Ensure, that it has the required permissions to ingest data over the endpoint.                                    |

Do not forget to configure the name chosen for `<your_token_field>` via the respective configuration property:

```sh
java #... \
-Dsap.dynatrace.cf.binding.token.name=<your_token_field> \
# ...

# or

SAP_DYNATRACE_CF_BINDING_TOKEN_NAME=<your_token_field>
java #...
```

## Generic OTLP Service Binding Exporter (vcap-service)

_This feature was introduced with version 4.3.0 of the extension._

The `vcap-service` exporter lets you ship logs, metrics, and traces to **any OTLP-compatible endpoint** that is described by a Cloud Foundry service binding.
Unlike the `cloud-logging` or `dynatrace` exporters, it does not require a specific service type.
The names of the credential fields that carry the endpoint URL, TLS certificates, and authentication token are freely configurable via environment variables.

### Enabling the vcap-service Exporter

Select it per signal with the standard OTel exporter environment variables:

```sh
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=vcap-service
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=vcap-service
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=vcap-service
```

Multiple exporters can be combined with comma separation, e.g., `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=cloud-logging,vcap-service`.

### Service Binding Format

The exporter reads the OTLP connection details from the credentials of a CF service binding.
It is compatible with both managed and user-provided service instances.
The credential field names are not fixed — you tell the exporter which field to read via configuration (see [Credential Mapping](#credential-mapping) below).

A minimal user-provided service binding using token authentication looks like this:

```json
{
  "user-provided": [{
    "name": "my-otlp-service",
    "label": "user-provided",
    "tags": [],
    "credentials": {
      "otlp-logs-endpoint":    "https://collector.example.com/v1/logs",
      "otlp-metrics-endpoint": "https://collector.example.com/v1/metrics",
      "otlp-traces-endpoint":  "https://collector.example.com/v1/traces",
      "auth-token": "Bearer my-token"
    }
  }]
}
```

A binding using mTLS instead of token authentication would provide three additional fields (client key, client certificate, and optionally the server CA certificate).

### Selecting the Service Binding

Use the following properties to tell the exporter which binding to use:

| Property | Env variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.name` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_NAME` | Exact name of the service binding. | _(first matching binding)_ |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.label.value` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_LABEL_VALUE` | Filter by service label (e.g. `user-provided`). | _(any label)_ |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.tag.value` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_TAG_VALUE` | Filter by service tag. | _(any tag)_ |

At least `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.name` or one of the filter properties should be set, otherwise the first binding in `VCAP_SERVICES` is picked.

### Credential Mapping

The following properties name the credential field that holds each piece of connection information.
Setting a property to the value `my-field` means the exporter reads `credentials["my-field"]` from the chosen service binding.

| Property | Env variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.credentials.otlp.endpoint` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_CREDENTIALS_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Credential field that holds the OTLP endpoint URL (fallback for all signals). | _(required unless signal-specific keys are set)_ |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.credentials.otlp.logs.endpoint` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_CREDENTIALS_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` | Credential field for the OTLP logs endpoint URL. Falls back to `otlp.endpoint`. | _(falls back to `otlp.endpoint`)_ |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.credentials.otlp.metrics.endpoint` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_CREDENTIALS_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` | Credential field for the OTLP metrics endpoint URL. Falls back to `otlp.endpoint`. | _(falls back to `otlp.endpoint`)_ |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.credentials.otlp.traces.endpoint` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_CREDENTIALS_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | Credential field for the OTLP traces endpoint URL. Falls back to `otlp.endpoint`. | _(falls back to `otlp.endpoint`)_ |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.credentials.otlp.auth-token` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_CREDENTIALS_OTLP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Credential field that holds the authentication token. Not required when mTLS is used. | _(no token authentication)_ |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.credentials.otlp.auth-header-name` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_CREDENTIALS_OTLP_AUTH_HEADER_NAME` | Name of the HTTP header used to send the token. | `Authorization` |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.credentials.otlp.client-key` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_CREDENTIALS_OTLP_CLIENT_KEY` | Credential field that holds the mTLS client private key in PEM format. | _(no mTLS)_ |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.credentials.otlp.client-cert` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_CREDENTIALS_OTLP_CLIENT_CERT` | Credential field that holds the mTLS client certificate in PEM format. | _(no mTLS)_ |
| `sap.vcap-service.cf.binding.credentials.otlp.server-cert` | `SAP_VCAP_SERVICE_CF_BINDING_CREDENTIALS_OTLP_SERVER_CERT` | Credential field that holds the trusted server CA certificate in PEM format. When not set and mTLS is used, the extension downloads the certificate from the endpoint automatically. | _(auto-download when mTLS is configured)_ |

**Endpoint URL format**: The endpoint URL must include the full path for `http/protobuf` (e.g. `https://collector.example.com/v1/logs`). For `grpc`, provide the host and port without a path (e.g. `https://collector.example.com:443`).

**Authentication**: Exactly one of token authentication or mTLS must be configured. When a token field is set, mTLS credential fields are ignored.

### Export Settings

General settings apply to all signals. Per-signal settings take precedence when set.

| Property | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `otel.exporter.vcap-service.protocol` | Transport protocol: `http/protobuf` or `grpc`. | `http/protobuf` |
| `otel.exporter.vcap-service.compression` | Compression: `gzip` or `none`. | `gzip` |
| `otel.exporter.vcap-service.timeout` | Export timeout (e.g. `10000ms`, `30s`). | _(OTel SDK default)_ |
| `otel.exporter.vcap-service.logs.protocol` | Protocol for logs. Falls back to `vcap-service.protocol`. | _(from general)_ |

| `otel.exporter.vcap-service.traces.timeout` | Timeout for traces. Falls back to `vcap-service.timeout`. | _(from general)_ |

## Implementation Differences between Cloud-Logging and OTLP Exporter

The `cloud-logging` exporter provided by this extension is a facade for the `OtlpGrpcExporter` provided by the OpenTelemetry Java Agent, just like the `otlp` exporter.
The difference is just during the bootstrapping phase.
The main differences are:

* The `cloud-logging` exporter will send data to all found Cloud Logging bindings, while the `otlp` exporter uses the first CaaS or Cloud Logging binding found.
* The `otlp` configuration will write the required certificates and keys to temporary files, which are deleted when the JVM is shut down. The `cloud-logging` exporter will keep the secrets in memory.
* The `cloud-logging` exporter needs to be configured explicitly.
